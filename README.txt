Files:

visuals.py : has all the visualization logic, the same visualizations I used in other projects
frauddetection.py : has all the code snippets I used to analyse and design the different models using a jupyter notebook. The code will match the final report PDF. 
FinalReport.pdf is the report
Proposal.pdf is the proposal I had submitted and the link to the review is below:
